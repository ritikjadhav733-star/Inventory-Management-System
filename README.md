# Inventory-Management-System
O This project demonstrates my ability to build a practical system that solves a real-world problem. It showcases my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and my ability to handle user input and errors, ensuring the system is reliable and user-friendly.

O This project is a simple Inventory Management System, which is essentially a digital checklist for a business's products.
Think of it like a smart, automated spreadsheet for a shop's stock.

O The goal was to build a tool that helps a business owner answer three core questions instantly:

  1) What products do I have?

  2) How many of each product are on the shelf?

  3) How much is each product worth?

O Instead of using pen and paper or a complicated spreadsheet, this system allows a user to type in commands to:

  1) Add new items to their inventory.

  2) View all the products they have in stock.

  3) [Future Feature] Update the number of products on hand, like when a customer buys something or a new shipment arrives.

  4) [Future Feature] Remove an item from their list if they stop selling it.
